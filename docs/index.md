# Welcome to the `bycon` project documentation

## Bycon - a Python-based environment for the Beacon v2 genomics API

The `bycon` project - at least at its current stage - is a mix of _Progenetix_ (i.e. GA4GH object model derived, _MongoDB_ implemented) - data management, and the implementation of middleware & server for the Beacon API.

!!! info "Bycon Code"

    The `bycon` code is maintained in the [`progenetix/bycon` repository](http://github.com/progenetix/bycon/). Some additional utility scripts & functions can be found in the
    [`byconaut`](http://github.com/progenetix/byconaut/) repository but are so not (well) documented & may contain deprecated or "internal use" code.

More information about the original use _Progenetix_ case can be found [on the project's documentation site](https://docs.progenetix.org/).

For more information about `bycon` installation and use please see [installation](./installation)
and track the [changes](./changes) for updates (or getting insights into the developments
leading to the current state).
